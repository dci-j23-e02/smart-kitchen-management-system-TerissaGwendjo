### Assignment: Smart Kitchen Management System

#### Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to develop a Java application that interacts with a PostgreSQL database to manage a Smart Kitchen. The application will allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a single table named `appliances`. This table will store information about various kitchen appliances.

#### Requirements:

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Use PostgreSQL as the database.
   - Create a database named `smart_kitchen`.
   - Inside the `smart_kitchen` database, create a table named `appliances` with the following columns:
     - `id` (Primary Key, Integer, Auto Increment)
     - `name` (Text)
     - `type` (Text) - (e.g., Refrigerator, Oven, Dishwasher)
     - `status` (Text) - (e.g., On, Off)
     - `usage_time` (Integer) - (Total usage time in minutes)

2. **Java Application Development:**
   - Develop a Java application that uses JDBC to interact with the `smart_kitchen` database.
   - Implement the following functionalities:
     - **Insert New Appliance:** Allow users to add new appliances to the database.
     - **List All Appliances:** Retrieve and display a list of all appliances from the database.
     - **Update Appliance:** Allow users to update the details of an existing appliance (e.g., change status, update usage time).
     - **Delete Appliance:** Allow users to delete an appliance from the database.
     - **Find Appliance:** Allow users to search for an appliance by name.

3. **Code Organization:**
   - Follow the provided code structure and adapt it to the Smart Kitchen context.
   - Implement the `ApplianceDao` interface with methods for each of the required functionalities.
   - Use the `ConnectionFactory` class to manage database connections.
   - Create an `Appliance` class to represent the appliance entity.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement proper error handling for database operations.
   - Display meaningful error messages to the user in case of failures.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Document your code with comments explaining the purpose of methods and key code blocks.
   - Include instructions on how to set up the database and run the application.

#### Deliverables:

1. **Source Code:**
   - Provide all the Java source files required to run the application.
   - Include the SQL script for creating the `appliances` table in the `smart_kitchen` database.

2. **README File:**
   - Include a README file with:
     - Instructions on how to set up the PostgreSQL database and create the required table.
     - Steps to compile and run the Java application.
     - A brief description of each functionality implemented in the application.





Good luck, and have fun building your Smart Kitchen Management System!
